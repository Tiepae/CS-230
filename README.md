Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
- The client is The Gaming Room, and they requested a web-based version of their current Android game, "Draw It or Lose It." The game is a drawing and guessing competition where teams compete to guess phrases based on rendered images. The software requirements include support for multiple teams, unique game and team names, player assignment to teams, and ensuring only one game instance exists in memory.
   
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
- I believe that I outlined the strengths and weaknesses of all OS platforms in tandem with the Gaming Room requirements pretty well.
    
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
- The document helped in thoroughly understanding the software requirements. It outlined specific functionalities, user interactions, and system behaviors, 
ensuring that the development team had a comprehensive understanding of what needed to be implemented.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
- If I were to revise one part of the work on these documents, I would focus on enhancing the section related to error handling and availability checks for unique names
  
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
- User needs were interpreted by understanding The Gaming Room's desire for a seamless, engaging, and collaborative gaming experience.
- Considering user needs is crucial because it ensures the software aligns with the client's expectations, leading to a more successful and user-friendly application.
    
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
- Considering user needs is crucial because it ensures the software aligns with the client's expectations, leading to a more successful and user-friendly application.
- Creating mockups for UI design, and ensuring scalability and uniqueness in the backend. For strategies, if I were dealing with clients I would maintain regular communication to understand the needs of the user.
